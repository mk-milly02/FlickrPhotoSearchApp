# FlickrPhotoSearchApp
An app that takes in a search string and displays photographs that match that search string. Uses Flickrâ€™s public photo feed at https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/ as a service. And also displays tweets based on the same search string using the Twitter API.
